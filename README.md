# Bat-Ascend

Welcome to "Bat Ascend," a Unity 3D game that challenges players to guide a bat to the summit of a treacherous mountain. Strap in for a thrilling adventure that will put your keyboard and mouse maneuvering skills to the test!

## Objective

Navigate the bat through a perilous mountain ascent, avoiding falling meteors and aiming for the mountaintop, and take shelter under the umbrella!

## Controls

- Use the keyboard "WASD" to control the bat's movement.
- Employ the mouse for a 360-degree camera rotation (freelook feature).

## Bat Abilities

The bat starts with basic capabilities and must skillfully avoid meteors. However, finding a "Red bull" drink will temporarily grant the bat the power of flight for a limited time.

## Lives

The bat has three attempts (lives) to conquer the mountain. If hit by a meteor, the bat is respawned to the starting position at the mountain's foothill (and loses 1 life).




## Game Dynamics

- A direct hit by a meteor on the bat will result in a respawn to the foothill and losing 1 life.
- If a meteor collides with a "Red bull" can, it will be destroyed.

## Winning and Losing

The game concludes when either:
1. The bat successfully reaches the mountaintop and touches the umbrella model (asset provided).
2. The bat is hit three times by meteors and exhausts its lives.
